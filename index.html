    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a passionate explorer of tech, creativity, and life's challenges. I love learning, having intimate conversations, and connecting with people.
        Curiosity and positivity guide me, even through life's tougher moments. I bring a genuine touch to everything i do, finding joy in hearing stories and helping others heal.
        Every project is an opportunity to grow, to share, and to create something meaninful. I am on a journey to seek freedom, the kind that comes from breaking chains of where i started.
